# ConXiu-Server


The Only thing missing is the node_modules folder which gitHub woudln't let me upload due to the file size.
You can download the repository and install the node_modules folder yourself by using the command "sudo npm install i" inside the repo directory on your local Ubuntu machine which should install the folder.
