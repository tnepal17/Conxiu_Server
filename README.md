# ConXiu-Server

Back End API for the Alternate Reality Game Conxiu.

Utilizes: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB(mongoose), AWS(Ec2)

The Only thing missing is the node_modules folder which gitHub woudln't let me upload due to the file size.
You can install the node_modules folder by using the command "sudo npm install i".
